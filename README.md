# JIKTDev Todo App

## WHAT
A To-do app!

## WHY

To allow the user to 
- __enter tasks__ they need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them, 
- __view the tasks__ they have added in a list so that they can plan their day and 
- __mark tasks__ as complete so that they can focus on the tasks they have left.

To __also__ allow the user to:

-   __edit their to-dos__ so that they can amend them if the task changes,
-   __click on any part of a to-do__ to mark it as complete so that it's easier for them to check to-dos off,
-   have a __visual indication__ of which to-do they're about to interact with so that it's clear what they are editing.


## HOW

### Day 1
* We discussed our priorities approaching this project, how best we should approach it, and lessons learned from our [previous project](https://github.com/fac-13/JIKTDEVS).
* Before splitting into groups, we:
    * worked through our the logic of how our page would function - ensuring we were all clear on all points
    *
